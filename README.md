The contents of this repo contain the code used to prepare sample data sets used in my portfolio projects
Additional code is for the following purposes:
  - Recreating visualizations in projects with Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib etc.)
  - Further statistical analysis of sample data sets (Regressions, A/B Tests etc.)
  - Practice and document Machine Learning Models for future use / reference or iterations
